Weather Data Assignment – Lesson 1

---

Question 1
Determine which one of the files is the CSV format file.

The CSV file is the file that, when opened in a plain text editor, shows comma‑separated values with a clear header row. A valid CSV file contains rows like:

time,temp,dew,hum,speed,gust,dir,rain,baro
00:00,14.1,11.1,82,0,0,0,0,1021

The file that displays this consistent comma‑separated structure is the CSV format file.

Question 2
R expression using read.csv() with a full path.

weather <- read.csv("C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/data20130101.csv")
head(weather)

---

Question 3
R expressions using setwd() and read.csv().

setwd("C:/Users/YourName/Downloads")
weather <- read.csv("data20130101.csv")
head(weather)

---

Question 4
Open "data20130101.csv" using row.names = 1.

This treats the time column as row names.

day1 <- read.csv("data20130101.csv", row.names = 1)
head(day1)

---

Question 5
Calculate the minimum and maximum values in the first CSV file.

minValue <- min(day1)
maxValue <- max(day1)

minValue
maxValue

---

Question 6
Convert the maximum value from hectopascals to psi.

maxPSI <- maxValue * 0.0145037738
maxPSI

---

Question 7
Calculate the maximum value across all 9 CSV files.

files <- sprintf("data201301%02d.csv", 1:9)

overallMax <- -Inf

for (f in files) {
d <- read.csv(f, row.names = 1)
overallMax <- max(overallMax, max(d))
}

overallMax

---

Question 8
Flow diagram and pseudocode.

Flow Diagram (Text Description)

START
→ Set working directory
→ Read first CSV file
→ Compute minimum and maximum values
→ Convert maximum value to PSI
→ Initialize overallMax
→ Loop through all 9 CSV files
→ Update overallMax if a larger value is found
→ Output results
END

Pseudocode

Set working directory
Read first CSV file with row names
Compute minValue and maxValue
Convert maxValue to PSI
Set overallMax to a very small number
For each CSV file:
Read file
Find maximum value in file
Update overallMax if necessary
Display minValue, maxValue, maxPSI, and overallMax
